##### I literally threw this together over the course of 2 days.

Currently, I am working on making the landing page fun and ridiculous. If getting ahead in the world of software development means I gotta maintain a website/blog and whatnot, then I refuse to not have fun doing it. I'm still trying to figure out markdown, but it doesn't seem overly complicated. In this moment, I'm very grateful for how web technology has progressed to the point where, for fun, I can just throw together an entire blog with a moderated comment system and everything in just a couple days. And a stylish one, at that!

It's weird to think that I had never even tried to code something before 3 years ago. Life is weird but I'm happy about it.

I kinda feel like there's infinite possibilities in front of me right now. I'm a software developer, and I have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-exline-b9b369201/), so I'm constantly being contacted by recruiters, sometimes several times a week. This is a great problem to have, obviously, but I'm disoriented by the constant threat of a better job opportunity that could just upend my life without any warning. "Hey Ethan, want a job that pays twice as much on the opposite coast of the country, thousands of miles from almost every single person you care about and everything you love and are comfortable with???" Past a certain point, for one's family, it seems like it would be irresponsible or cowardly to refuse such an opportunity! 

Of course, this is a pretty vain line of thinking, in particular for somebody like me who, at this point, only has 2 years of professional experience in IT work. I do hope that perhaps maintaining my own site (and a blog, however not-relevant-to-actual-coding it may end up being) will bump me up to the next tier.

But heck, it might just be fun to have a blog, anyway.
