##### I want to get better at the real code fundamentals.

So, I will be documenting my journey toward learning about and how/when/why to use all the popular (and maybe less popular as well) algorithms, data structures, and  so 1. I can track my own progress and 2. I can provide a free, curated learning source for those who come after me. Below is a list of topics I'd like to approach, which will be replaced by a link to the post when/if I get to it.

* BFS for Big Fat Schmucks

* DFS for Dull Foolish Saps

* Divide-and-Conquer for Doofs-and-Clods

* Binary Trees for Blockhead Twits

* Tries for Turkeys

* Linked Lists for Lame Loons

* Sliding Window for Slimy Weirdos

* Sorts for Sods

* Fisher-Yates for Funky-Yahoos

* Big O() for Big Oafs

* Hash Map for Hopeless Morons

* Regex for Rubes

* Recursion for Rot-brains

* Heap for Hucksters

* Stack for Stupids

* Queue for Quacks

* Threading for Thickwits

* Greedy for Goofs

* Dynamic Programming for Dimwitted Pinheads

* System Design for Silly Dinguses

Stay tuned for updates.
