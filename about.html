                    23 years of figuring out what in the heck I wanted to do with my life, through doing jobs I was bad at, 
                    getting married, and playing lots of video games. Not necessarily in that order.

                     Went back to school, and found out I absolutely loved Software Development. I learned in the morning, and worked nights. I made straight A's, got recommended for 
                     my first programming job by the Head of Technology at the college, and had a 4.0 GPA (if you're only counting IT classes!) - I even found the time to build my 
                     own computer!

                     While finishing up school, I began my professional career with a position as a Progammer/Developer at a medium-sized trucking company. It was a fantastic place
                     to learn and I rapidly developed my skills, diving deep into their piles of data and deriving meaning from the chaos with data visualization, reporting, 
                     sending and receiving information with tons of APIs, and buiding tools to help the company to stay compliant with the law in a heavily-regulated industry. 
                     I got to get my hands dirty, learned how to communicate effectively and deliver solutions to problems my company faced, and built some really fun and 
                     interesting sofware.

                    Now, as I work as the sole developer for a small software vendor in the Mental Health industry, I get to work daily on a huge variety of projects. Responsive,
                    full-stack web applications with .NET web development, a front-end redesign of a legacy application, GUI programs to help my coworkers, web-based payment
                    portals that use SAML as the SSO - running the gamut. I maintain this site with my free time, and I'm always down for new, interesting projects. Feel free to
