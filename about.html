                    getting married, and playing lots of video games. Not necessarily in that order.

                     Went back to school, and found out I absolutely loved Software Development. I learned in the morning, and worked nights. I made straight A's, got recommended for 
                     my first programming job by the Head of Technology at the college, and had a 4.0 GPA (if you're only counting IT classes!) - I even found the time to build my 
                     own computer!

                     In my penultimate semester of college, I began my professional career with a position as a Progammer/Developer at a medium-sized trucking company. It was a 
                     fantastic place to learn and I rapidly developed my skills, diving deep into their piles of data and deriving meaning from the chaos with data visualization, 
                     reporting, sending and receiving information with tons of APIs, and buiding tools to help the company to stay compliant with the law in a heavily-regulated 
                     industry. I got to get my hands dirty, learned how to communicate effectively and deliver solutions to problems my company faced, and built some really fun 
                     and interesting sofware.

                    Now, as I work as the lone software developer for a small software vendor in the Mental Health industry, I get to work daily on a huge variety of projects. 
                    Responsive, full-stack web applications with .NET web development, a front-end redesign of a legacy application, GUI programs to help my coworkers, web-based 
                    payment portals that use SAML as the SSO - running the gamut. I maintain this site with my free time, and I'm always down for new, interesting projects.

        <u><h3>About Me</h3></u>
        <p>
            My name is Ethan Exline. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            In case that was unclear.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            My hobbies include being ok at the drums, getting frustrated at video games, making computers do dumb things, and accidentally becoming a subject matter expert in something
            stupid over the course of an afternoon. I tend to lose the forest for the trees, laugh heartily at my own jokes, and hyperfixate on random topics for weeks at a time. 
            I have fun trying to do difficult things and I like to think that the challenge of overcoming personal obstacles is slowly making me healthier, cooler, and more buff.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Most importantly, I'm a Christian and my hope would be that you'd reserve judgement on that point until after you get to know me. (I'd love to talk to you about it
            though!) I'm also married to the love of my life and the mother of my 2 cats and 2 dogs: Sam, Krispie, Butterbean, and Pickles (see below).
        </p>
