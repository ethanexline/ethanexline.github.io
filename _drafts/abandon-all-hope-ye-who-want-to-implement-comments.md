##### I'm begging you, please just make a comment to make me feel better.

When I started this blog, like, a week ago, I chose to take the simplest route for implementing a comment system, which is Disqus. You just gotta stick a `comments: true` in the front matter of the post and cram their cheeky little `UNIVERSAL EMBED CODE` at the end of your post template. Certainly not rocket science (not to mention there is a free tier, and I'm a miserly cad who ain't gonna pay for **nothing**), so for the purposes of quickly building and launching a blog, not too bad, right?

### SPOILER: there is a caveat.

Of course, a company's gotta pay their employees somehow - so how does Disqus do it? Well, the same way every other internet-services company does - serving ads. In between the comments, _within_ the comments, in the Recommendations (I don't even know what this is) - looking at their sample gives a good idea of the type of saturation you'll be dealing with: ![Don't you love comments sections that look like this?](/assets/images/ads.png "Don't you love comments sections that look like this?")

I can't speak for anybody else, but a blog that bombards you with ads is, best case scenario, an absolute sensory overload, and worst case scenario, frustrating to the point of driving me away from the site.
