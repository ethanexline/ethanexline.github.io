##### I suspect I'm not alone in feeling like, in a lot of ways, I've "drank the Kool-aid" of society's expectations for me.

Have you ever had a moment, for no reason in particular, where you have suddenly realized that you've been gliding through life on autopilot? That is, you've gone though life thoughtlessly, unplanned, reactively, dealt with any and all problems that arise in a provisional and transitory way, forbidden your brain from descending past the surface level of anything, and generally allowed yourself to be led and act from pure impulse and muscle memory, especially for an extended period of time? I recently emerged from an autopilot period I had been in for at least 6 months, and the weight of that revelation was crushing.

During this time I contributed nothing to society, participated very poorly in the creative projects I was part of, produced almost nothing and spent every free moment consuming joyless, junk food content from Youtube (you know what I'm talking about - compilations, speedruns for video games I've never played, people making food, or knives, or doing wood turning or other various crafts, etc.), took  no initiative or even a  single proactive measure in the home or at work, and was overall just a distant, unengaged,  lazy,  useless friend, employee, and husband. I was incapable of  participating well in anything involving thought beneath surface level, or passion, or creativity, or planning, or even the suggestion of extra responsibilities - heck, it  could barely be said that I was conscious. 

Upon my awakening, I felt a deluge of feelings -  gratitude that my friends and family (and most of all, my spouse) didn't abandon me in my congnitive absence; bleary panic, like when a nightmare shocks you awake at 3AM;  joy, like when your plane touches back down in your home town after a long trip; anxiety, thinking about all the problems I had either created or made worse while I was gone; fear over the fact that I was capable of mentally disappearing but remaining physically present. I had done the people I treasure  most <u>real</u> dirty. I let my professional skill stagnate and the codebases I work on rot. Functionally, I'd  lost a meaningfully large portion of life, with nothing positive to show for it.

"I can now see that I spent most of my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked". I find this sentence **terrifying**.

Having come to, I immediately set about the task of being a real person again, back into willful, cognizant participation in life. It certainly didn't feel like a moment for reflection; I'd probably had plenty of  time for that while I was lost in the sub-conscious  brain jungle. I had  relationships to mend, apologies to make, responsibilities to  catch back up on, songs to  write, life to live! And yet,  it was  in the midst  of all the ensuing life-doing that I had a moment of clarity and was able to realize what exactly had sent me away in the first place: a jam-packed schedule full of joyless busyness and obligations that denied me any spare moments of quiet peace, or  recreation, or passion-pursuing, or anything that legitimately felt like my choice. Just duty, money-making, errands, business, and needs-meeting between nights with too little sleep, rinsed and repeated week after week. I could  see clearly that path that led me down my dissociative road - overwhelmed by a particular stressor and with no outlet, I would simply say in my head, "continuing to worry about and give myself fully to this is killing me. I will simply not allow myself to think about  this thing anymore." The numbness that came from ignoring  my problems felt pretty nice in comparison to the crippling stress, so, bit by bit, pretty much  all my stressors found their way to the we-can't-think-about-this list, leaving only the physical appearance of existing behind. Once you care about nothing, so long as those around you  are willing to meet the needs you're ignoring in your  absence, you are able to eke out a flat, meaningless, novocaine existence, which, from a very zoomed-out perspective, seems marginally better than a life of constant, overwhelming stress. 

2 things about this scared me: 
1. Right there in that moment, I was squarely in the same place that sent me away in the first place.
2. I wasn't sure if there was actually anything I could give up to lighten my load.
