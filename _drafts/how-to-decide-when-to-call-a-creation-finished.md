##### Bold of me to compare myself to a painter, or really to an artist of any kind!

I have decided that, pending another \**spark*\*, the landing page for my site is complete. The three views are functional and behave as expected in both desktop and mobile views - the only behavior I'd really like to change is that the start menus don't dismiss when clicked outside of on mobile. Oops, I accidentally fixed it. (thank you [hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/)) Ok, it's already kind of a moot point because in between the writing of the last sentence and this one, I've already made like 150 changes, but I fully **in**tend to **pre**tend that I'm gonna stop doing that. To that end, I posit this question:

###### How do "creatives" know when a "piece" is done?
