##### I just want to have this somewhere I can always get to it.

This is the newest borgest alimony delivery patient. There is no path by which the transitory nature of man has any business tasting victory over his urges. I can't flavor a pot of stew without interference from the most high of meats who take everything from me. I taste defeat, sweet defeat, in my feet. Borgogne is the becoming of a new lark. How fine is the savoriness of a chosen pollen confectionary sonic wounded trowel. Can't I get any sleep?? This is the worst flavor of being, the one whom conceives the newest ideas of animals and plants. Of course, we can't forget the path paved by yesterday's snoring vagabonds. I cheese and I squeeze and I clench and destroy. Say, isn't there another tooth growing from the ceiling? Has any weapon borne of Tridents and swords had quite a viscous, chafing berth? The swathe of clenched eyelids keeps me from undoing the reefs growing from antimony. Allegory, worst Allegory, has once again been a gory glass pope.

I have no teeth and the best way to combat a raging rihnocerous is also the best way to eat fruit. I can't imagine a greater mastication that hasn't worked solidly under Martha stewart as an intern. Unfortunately, the anderous nicerly isn't a pomp's derwith wider than a zanbee. Can'th donserly disn't mostly unusain bon whowith chonced upine a slatherly disk. Whenst, I hasthn't vontered a folume snuck and I gonst to fort a dee. Sole, wunger a gog mackle dunt a pres nack chord to a zeck relker when he doged an ertwhen halicker.
