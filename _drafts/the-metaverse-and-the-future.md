##### I've been thinking a lot about the future recently.

Facebook's recent annoucement of its changing focus to the "metaverse", reflected in the parent company's name change to Meta, leads me personally to feel just a touch of existential angst. I think about certain folks who were born in the 1890's, who were still broadly using horses as their exclusive means of transport in their childhood, and by the end of their lives saw man's first steps on the moon on television. To zoom out to this scope and ponder the implications for 90s kids like me is monumental, ego-killing, and a little scary. Though at this point the concept of a "metaverse" rests pretty squarely in the goofy hands of [one of the top 3 most memeable humans I know of](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr-dankmemes.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F667338188572999680&psig=AOvVaw0ySgk0tdtZR0jIpOFCEojV&ust=1637420895488000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCNjzl6rapPQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD), I would wager that _The Zucc_'s vision for the future is at least in agreement with the general direction of history, certainly the history that I have personally witnessed. There are numerous hot takes I've consumed that take one of two similar but distinct on the subject: either [the concept of a "metaverse" is not new and has never worked before so it won't work now and is therfore bad](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-was-always-terrible/620546/), or [the "metaverse" is coming and although it will inevitably be bad for humanity it might have some good parts](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/27/1036817/metaverse-facebook-virtual-reality-augmented/) - however, the number of articles you'll find upon googling the word "metaverse" that have one of these theses is vastly outnumbered by a third type of article that has a title that sounds something like, "7 reasons you should invest in the metaverse! #3 has doctors **reeling**!" This fact lends weight to my personal take on the future of the metaverse:

#### It's likely that some form of the metaverse is coming, because 1. that's where money is going, and 2. it has the potential to solve many of the problems that the youngest generation cares most deeply about.

I'm doubtful that it will be the exclusive work of Facebook's (_Meta's_, sorry) hands, but I find it very likely that some variation on the idea of a metaverse will come to fruition and find mainstream success. There are a few moderately successful metaverse "prototypes", such as Second Life and VRChat, which I also think have the capability of establishing a fully-realized vision of the metaverse (and with less legwork!), but Meta's ubiquity, mountains of cash money, giant work force, and the fact that they own Oculus all contribute to a unique capability to see 'ol Zuck's vision to completion as well. To explain this opinion, let's do some exhuming.

Think for a moment about the cartoon The Jetsons. If you're not familiar with the show itself, you're certainly familiar with its raison d'etre; Hi, it's the 60s and the space race is going on so here's a family sitcom cartoon that is set in _the future_, complete with [googie architechture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture) and flying cars and [food pills](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120221-food-pills-a-staple-of-sci-fi), all out in **space**! There's a couple things the show wasn't so far off on, but we can confidently say that the majority of the postulations that The Jetsons and other media of its ilk made were pretty short-sighted, and were mostly a reflection of their times, serving as fuctional caricatures of the moment they existed in - their "future" looked an awful lot like their present. Then the 70s and 80s came along and began building what was to become the internet, which, over the course of 30-40 years, entered the mainstream and changed everything. Of course, something like the modern internet would've been unfathomable as a deciding factor in the path of the future in the 60s; you might argue that very _very_ few people saw the power of the internet before it became broadly accessable in the early-mid 90s. No, the people of the Jetsons' era looked at the present to determine the future, as man is wont to do - we're concerned about the world's ability to feed a growing population, so we have food pills to accomodate. We see massive planes shoot into space - it's only a matter of time before our cars follow suit. We've just been introduced to the idea of robots and how they can be made to do things unpleasant or unsafe for us - it's only logical that we'll invite them into our homes so they can plunge our toilets for us. But we didn't end up pursuing a lot of these things, not because technology hasn't kept up or due to a lack of ambition, but for a bunch of mundane reasons: being hard to teach or regulate, or plain impracticality, or even the overestimation of the altruism of a "futuristic" society. You'll notice, however, these mundane reasons that stopped us from fulfilling these futuristic fantasies happen to apply equally or moreso to the most historically important thing that has appeared in pretty much any potential reader's lifetime, and which I've already made reference to: the internet. For all its impracticality, and impossibility to regulate, and potential to empower, encourage, and engage the darkest parts of our psyche, it has yet been, debatably, one of the most important and influential inventions of the last century, maybe longer. So the question, then, is this: what is responsible for the flourishing of the internet and the languishing of the flying car, and further, the direction of history in general? 1 little word: ***MONEY***.

I'm under no impression that this is, y'know, rocket science, or even that it's a particularly novel idea, but I think The Jetsons is proof that this isn't the way, broadly, that people think about the future. The lexicon of pop culture seems to be the more common source, abstractly informed by existing media and popular scientists, pundits, and talking heads.
